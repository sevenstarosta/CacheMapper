Progress made: using system prefs to store usernames and passwords and to check them. 
successfully read from gps upon hitting "create cache at my location" button
Have created a firebase database online at:
https://final-project-final-yanma.firebaseio.com/ 
NOTE: you cannot see this firebase or any changes to it without being able to log in. However, running the app with the debug console up shows no errors or warnings when you push to firebase. This means that pushing is successful.
successfully can upload different caches with cache name, current username logged in, description, as well as latitude and longitude.
successfully take a picture on the add cache screen, though have not yet managed to upload to firebase.
have three screens with navigation between. Can successfully logout which wipes password from edittext while leaving username.
